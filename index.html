      <p> 
        As a child, I remember hearing stories about duck-and-cover, and how Americans learned to live with the fear of imminent nuclear war.  Luckily, to my generation those feelings were only stories. By the time the eldest of us turned 10, the Soviet Union had already collapsed been discarded to the ash heap of history. The Cold War made for the perfect example of a simple plotline taught in grade school.  At the end of the movie, the heroes came home and had babies happily ever after.  We were those babies.</p>
      
       <p> This all changed the morning of January 13th when an emergency alert was sent to Hawaiian cell phones about an incoming ballistic missile. I found out about the threat just after the message was sent after a college friend posted a screenshot of the message to Facebook with an accompanying message.  I proceeded to scour the internet for any information I could, until Congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard tweeted that the message was a false alarm.  </p>
        
        <p>There are a lot of great reasons to live in rural America, but my favorite is that you are almost certainly not going to be on a list of strategic targets for a would-be nuclear adversary.  This line of thinking was exhibited during the Carter years, when the Office of Technology Assessment <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/charlottesville-a-government-commissioned-story-about-nuclear-war/551432/"> commissioned a fictional story</a> outlining how those Americans lucky enough to survive the initial nuclear exchange might survive.  Reagan would later move to abolish the agency as part of his “Contract with America”.   </p> 
     
        <p>During the height of the Cold War, there were <a href="http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-cold-war-close-calls">two instances</a> when the decision to go to nuclear war were at the hands of a single person.  The first was October 27, 1962 -  when Vasili Arkhipov, second-in-command of the nuclear-armed Soviet Submarine B-59, refused to give his consent in the necessary contingency measure requiring all three of the submarine’s senior officers to sign off.  The second was September 26, 1983 - Lt. Colonel Stanislav Petrov broke protocol and refused to notify Soviet high-command of an alert signaling an incoming American ICBM.  </p>
   
       <p> The United States had two great assets during the Cold War. For those who take no credence in mutually assured destruction (MAD), there was the benefit-of-the-doubt that not all the opposing governments citizens were deserving of nuclear fire.   Amongst those who did recognize the implications of MAD – was the desire for self-preservation.</p>
      
        <p>Last weekend, the Democratic candidates competing for the nomination to replace incumbent Congressman Tom Garrett participated in a forum at The Haven.  As can be expected in a Democratic Primary/Caucus, the candidates agreed on pretty much every policy.  Thus, my favorite question concerned what they thought were Garrett’s most formidable qualities.  Candidate Leslie Cockburn responded that Garrett is smart at leveraging his committee assignments alongside complex issues like the Iran deal and nuclear weapons to distract constituents.  Such issues are no distraction to me, so I made it a point to interface with my Congressman about the Iran Deal.  I got the opportunity to do during his January 29th radio town hall hosted by WCHV.</p>
       
        <p>Congressman Garrett’s response was beyond what I would have expected.  Yes, it was eloquent and smart and verbose.  It also revealed a lot about his view of the world.  The portion of the embedded interview relevant to this post begins at ~7:45.  My first question consisted of nervous mumbling concerning whether or not Tom Garrett would support removing the rule that States won't get Federal highway funding if they decide to set their drinking age lower than 21.  </p>

        <blockquote><i><p>“I tell you what, I can’t stand it, and I’ll tell you why.  If you look at the U.N. Resolution circa 2010 you‘ve got a wording that says Iran shall not. <a href="https://imgflip.com/i/245s5s">Shall not, shall being the operative term </a><a href="#section1">[1]</a>, undertake the testing of long range ballistic missiles or/of missiles designed to carry a nuclear payload, or capable of carrying a nuclear payload. In the JCPOA, the Iran deal says Iran is called upon not to, right? And when I had the opportunity to talk to one of the architects of the JCPOA … well he said we couldn’t get the Chinese and the Russians to sign off on a shall not.” </i> - Congressman Tom Garrett, embedded segment.</p></blockquote>
     
        <p>I am not a lawyer.  That said, I can tell you that ballistic technology is a small part of addressing nuclear capability, and that the most crucial aspects of such a deal are radiological in nature.  If you develop an ICBM, you don’t necessarily have a nuclear armament.  It’s just a normal missile with a stupid-long range.  You need to be able to put your nuclear bomb on top of an ICBM and accurately get it to the target.</p>
      
        <p>Congressman Garrett then proceeded to confirm that I’m correct that his preferred language ‘shall not’ would prohibit Iran from developing a space industry.  After all, an ICBM is just an unmanned rocket ship aimed at Earth.  He responded that I was "completely right, except…"
        Now, if one were to write a piano piece about what came out of the Congressman's mouth next, and one made sure to remove any-and all piano sounds for any bit of bravo-sierra in the Congressman's response -- one would have a masterpiece much akin to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2zcLBr_VM"> John Cage's 4'33''</a>.    In no way was the response relevant to matters of ballistics, let alone nuclear weapons as a whole.  Instead, the Congressman decided to confide with his live audience that he does not trust what the Iranians say to the world – "we must listen to what they say internally in Farsi."
      
        <p>Not taking what the Iranian government says to the international community at face value is one thing.  I’m thankful that international community didn’t take our current administration at face value when President Trump threatened to pull out of NATO, but Congressman Garrett went as far to cite the Mullahs who have “literally called for the eradication of those who disagree with them.”</p>
   
        <p>Former President George W. Bush had many <a href="https://www.edweek.org/media/2015/04/09/26-george-bush-signs-nclb-act-2002.jpg">problems</a> but stating that
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygTbwGrTELc">Islam is a religion of peace</a> in the wake of 9/11 is not <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/46_Dick_Cheney_3x4.jpg/220px-46_Dick_Cheney_3x4.jpg"> one of them</a>.   The benefit-of-the-doubt in the minds of foreigners that not all Americans deserve nuclear fire is just as crucial to our security looking forward as it was during the Cold War.  There is an <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/1/3/16841310/iran-protests-2018"> entire generation of young Iranians </a> skeptical of their theocracy that the Congressman claims to support, but his foreign policy would perpetuate the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/02/05/iran-cia-coup-mossadegh-ayatollah/"> institutions that have fueled the Ayatollahs regime.</a></p>  
 
     
         <p>Imagine leaders of authoritarian theocracies meeting for peace-talks aboard the International Space Station or similar vessel.  Give them a full, personal view of the world as they discuss how many more need to die in the name of their respective Gods. The single greatest enemy to theocracy is scientific literacy. Why would Congressman Garrett ever want to keep that conversation from happening?</p>
