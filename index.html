      <h2><u> Dominion's Double Billion Blunder </u></h2>
      <h3><i>...and other reasons why the Grid Transportation Security Act was nothing more than a continuation of a long, proud history of raiding ratepayers.</i></h3>
      <h4>Matt Glattfelder, July 13, 2018 </h4>
   
     <p> Dominion, one of Virginia’s regional energy monopolies, has a track record of cozying up to our General Assembly at the detriment of the average Virginian.  Last year alone, the utility spent $1 million on political lobbying. Still, the $1 million spent on lobbying is not nearly the most egregious ramification of the process and passage of the Grid Transformation Security Act.  Instead, the ratepayer is gouged the greatest from a planned $2 billion investment in our transmission systems.  Specifically, to ‘underground’ portions of our power lines.  That means exactly what you think it means.  Relocating $2 billion worth of power lines from above ground to below ground.</p><a href="#section1">[1]</a>

     <p>In order to fully appreciate how ridiculous of an investment this is, we need to go back to when Dominion first traces its corporate roots.  Two years before the surrender at Yorktown, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the creation of the Appomattox Trustees by charter.  The trustees established The Upper Appomattox Company to improve the navigability of the Appomattox river.  Prior to the invention of the railroad, rivers were the most efficient means of transporting commerce in our Republic.  Over the years, a total of 235 companies contributed to the corporate ancestry of Dominion Energy.  Dominion takes the care to state on their website that their ancestry is “as diverse as real estate, horse-shoe manufacturing, water power, ice making, coal mining, railway and ferry service, trolley cars and street lighting.”  The first time the corporate ancestry functioned in a way like Dominion Energy does today was in 1909, when the Virginia Railway and Power Company was incorporated to operate railways, supply electric power and distribute manufactured gas to customers. An early addition was the Rappahannock Company, which was tasked in 1812 with performing the same duties as The Upper Appomattox Company, this time along the Rappahannock River region. </p><a href="#section2">[2]</a>

     <p>It’s amusing that Dominion takes the care to mention the Rappahannock Company on their website’s history page because they don’t even distribute electricity through most of the Rappahannock River region.  Neither Dominion nor the corporate ancestors ever actually got around to electrifying the rural parts of Virginia.  They weren’t the only company ignoring the countryside, so Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Rural Electrification Administration by executive order in 1935.  The REA helped establish electrical co-ops across rural America, one of which is the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative (REC).</p><a href="#section3">[3]</a>

     <p> To this day, most of Dominion’s customers exist in the urban regions of the state.  Rural regions are served largely by other organizations, such as REC and Appalachian Power, and happen to be those which need undergrounding the most.  Looking backwards, Dominion Energy has a proven track-record of cozying up to the Virginia General Assembly at the expense of ratepayers.  Looking forwards, the Virginia General Assembly has allowed Dominion Energy to double-down on centralized grid architecture.  The future of grid security is in de-centralization, but that is a discussion for another day.</p><a href="#section4">[4]</a>
