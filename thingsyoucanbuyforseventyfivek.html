      <p> 
      On March 5th, the Charlottesville City Council voted to appropriate $75,000 of taxpayer money to the Downtown Business Association for the purposes of 'marketing'.  This has the potential to do some good, but it probably won't. I say this mainly because I've been unable to find an itemized list of purchases that will constitute the 75K. 
      </p>

     <p> 
      Giving the Downtown Business Association the benefit of the doubt, I'm going to assume that the testimony I heard in favor of this appropriation was more of a cry for help as opposed to an assertion of belief in a plan of action.  Fear no longer, for I'm about to outline as many things I can think of in the next half hour that would be a better investment than ambiguous "marketing".</p>
      
      <h5><b>Pet-Friendly Water Fountains</b></h5>

      <p> I'm not going to sugar coat it - people can really suck sometimes. You want to know who never sucks?  Pets.  I can't think of a single place on the downtown mall - Charlottesville's so-called mecca of community inclusion - where service dogs can get water for free  without their human having to (god-forbid) interact with a stranger and maybe make a new friend.  We absolutely couldn't afford a water-fountain as beautiful as the one on the left of this article.  <a href="https://www.dog-on-it-parks.com/fountains-and-water-features-1.html">Don't even think about being about to afford 20 of them and still have 20K left over for the assocaited labor and connecting parts.</a>   </p>

      <h5><b>Getting Rid of the Most Useless Traffic Light I've Ever Come Across</b></h5>

      <p> Have you ever had the misfortune of sitting at this light with NOBODY around, wondering why the city would waste <a href="https://wsdot.wa.gov/Operations/Traffic/signals.htm">~$8,000 a year</a> operating this logistically irrelevant and economically wasteful piece of machinery?[1]</p>


      <h5> <b> Building a New Skatepark</b></h5>
      <p> When I was growing up I spent a lot of time at the McIntire Skatepark.  Not only was it great excercise, but it was an activity that helped socialize me with kids growing up in environments that were different than my suburban neighborhood of Puddle Reynovia.  A few years ago I heard something about a Tony Hawk foundation grant where City Council would match it for a new park...  
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/construction-to-begin-on-skate-park-bridge/article_9b1d894c-ffd3-11e7-95d9-5bade5e8e6dd.html">I wonder what happened to that... [2]</a>  </p>

      <h5><b>Locking the Lee and Jackson Park-Statues Inside the <a href="http://www.cvilletomorrow.org/news/article/29647-dewberry-hotel-design-review-postponed/">Landingleberry Hotel</a></b></h5>
      <p> If you aren't going to take the trash to the landfill yourselves, at least put it all in one place for the guy who's job it is to do it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Then hire someone to do it.</p>

      <h5><b>Subsidize Parking for Service Industry (Read: Tipped) Employees</b></h5>
      <p> You want to know what sucks?  Having to spend more than fifty percent of the money you earn over your 8 hour restaurant shift on parking because you only make $2.50 an hour without tips and no matter how much your management might want to be a hopping breakfast place - it just isn't meant to be. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Invest In The Railroads Between Charlottesville and Crozet to Create An Awesome Public Transportation Option Between the Two Downtowns </b></h5>

      <p>  Anyone who has lived in the area longer than our lovely undergrad-and-out demographic knows that Crozet is the satellite-town of choice for Charlottesville/Albemarle's growing middle class.  Back in the old-days, Charlotesville and Crozet used to be united by passenger rail. The structures that served as the stations are still standing.     All you would need to do is a little renovation to the already existing infrastructure. You can't get more efficient than that.  The downtown former rail-station also happens to be right across the Street from the Charlottesville Area Transit station, giving near-instant access to the existing CAT hub.  If that isn't kismet I don't know what is.[3]
